# Drone-jamming-deetction-algorithm
This repository implements machine learning models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Decision Tree, to identify and mitigate drone jamming attacks. The project focuses on robust feature extraction and model training to ensure high accuracy in detecting jamming signals."

The model workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Collection and cleaning of signal datasets, including normalization and feature extraction.
Feature Engineering: Extraction of critical features from communication signals, such as signal strength, frequency variations, and noise patterns.
Model Training: Training MLP and Decision Tree models on processed datasets to identify patterns associated with jamming attacks.
Evaluation: Comparing the performance of both models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Real-time Detection: Deploying the trained model to monitor drone communication channels in real-time and flagging potential jamming incidents.

Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset used for model training and evaluation is not included in this repository. Users are encouraged to use their own datasets or publicly available alternatives that comply with licensing requirements."
